                                manage.py
manage.py --> it has to manage the project

@app.route("/") #route(path) --> urls.py
def index() #function in views.py
views.py --> function

run the server using the command:
    python manage.py runserver host_name:port_no

2. views.py --> function (which will run on that particular path)
